# Create a New Block

Use this skill when creating a new block from scratch or wiring an existing scaffolded block into the page lifecycle.

## Block file structure

Every block lives in its own folder under `blocks/`. The folder name must exactly match the class name that `loadBlock` uses to resolve it.

```
blocks/
  <block-name>/
    <block-name>.js
    <block-name>.css
```

## How `loadBlock` resolves a block

```js
export async function loadBlock(block) {
  const { components } = getConfig();
  const [name] = block.classList;       // first class = block name
  block.dataset.blockName = name;
  const style = !components.some((cmp) => name === cmp); // load CSS unless opted out
  await loadExperience(block, 'blocks', name, style);
  return block;
}
```

Key rules:
- The **first class** on the element is the block name — no secondary `block` class is needed.
- `loadExperience` loads `blocks/<name>/<name>.js` and, if `style` is true, `blocks/<name>/<name>.css`.
- CSS loads automatically for all blocks unless the block name is listed in the `components` array in `scripts.js` (currently `['fragment', 'schedule']`). Add a block there only if it manages its own CSS loading.
- **No registration required** — adding a folder under `blocks/` with matching JS and CSS files is sufficient.

## The `init(el)` contract

```js
export default async function init(el) {
  // el is the block's DOM element
  // populate it — don't create a new container
}
```

- `el` is whatever element was passed to `loadBlock` — could be a `<div>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, etc.
- The caller (template or page) may have already set `className`, `aria-label`, and other attributes on `el`. **Do not overwrite them.**
- Append content into `el` directly. Use `el.replaceChildren()` only when the block is authored directly in a page document with no template pre-creating it.
- `init` is `async` — `await` any fetches before appending content.

## How templates inject blocks

Templates live in `templates/<name>/<name>.js` and run when a page's `template` metadata matches. They pre-create the block element and call `loadBlock`, which resolves the matching block JS by class name.

```js
import { loadBlock } from '../../scripts/ak.js';

export default async function init() {
  const main = document.querySelector('main');

  const wrapper = document.createElement('div');
  wrapper.className = 'template-wrapper';

  const myBlock = document.createElement('div');
  myBlock.className = 'my-block';           // must match blocks/my-block/ folder
  myBlock.setAttribute('aria-label', '...'); // set accessibility attributes here

  await loadBlock(myBlock); // triggers blocks/my-block/my-block.js init(el)

  main.replaceWith(wrapper);
  wrapper.append(myBlock, main);
}
```

For multiple independent blocks, load them in parallel:

```js
await Promise.all([loadBlock(sitenav), loadBlock(inPageNav)]);
```

## When to use templates vs per-page authoring vs fragments

| Approach | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| **Template** | Block appears on every page of a given type (e.g., sitenav on all `landing` and `detail` pages). Registered in `templates/<name>/`. |
| **Per-page authoring** | Block is content-specific — authors add it to individual pages in the document editor via a table with the block name as the header. |
| **Fragment** | Content is shared across pages but not global (not header/footer). Author a document at `/fragments/<path>` and reference it with a `fragment` block table on each page. |

Header and footer are special — they are baked into the HTML shell by the delivery pipeline, not authored per-page. `ak.js` finds those empty elements and calls `loadBlock` on them automatically.

## CSS file

`loadBlock` automatically loads `blocks/<name>/<name>.css` alongside the JS — no import needed. The CSS file should scope all styles to the block root class and use BEM for any child elements.

For the full CSS authoring reference — design tokens, light/dark mode, nesting conventions, media query syntax, reduced motion, and global utilities — see **[`.ai/skills/stylesheet-conventions/SKILL.md`](../stylesheet-conventions/SKILL.md)**.

## Querying data from the index

Dynamic blocks (sitenav, in-page-nav) fetch data at runtime rather than reading authored content.

```js
const resp = await fetch('/query-index.json');
if (!resp.ok) return;
const { data } = await resp.json();
```

`data` is an array of page objects: `{ path, title, description, ... }`.

Filter by the current top-level URL section:

```js
const [, topSection] = window.location.pathname.split('/');
const sectionPages = data.filter(({ path }) => path.startsWith(`/${topSection}/`));
```

For reading headings from the current page (TOC/in-page-nav pattern):

```js
const headings = [...document.querySelectorAll('main h2, main h3')]
  .filter((h) => !el.contains(h)); // exclude any headings inside the block itself
```

## Block variants and modifiers

Extra classes on a block element are variant/modifier flags. `loadBlock` always uses only the **first** class as the block name — additional classes do not affect which JS or CSS file loads. They are purely CSS targets.

```html
<!-- "centered" and "dark" are modifiers — only "hero" drives block resolution -->
<div class="hero centered dark">...</div>
```

```css
.hero {
  /* base styles */

  &.centered { text-align: center; }
  &.dark { background-color: var(--s2-gray-1000); color: var(--s2-gray-25); }
}
```

If a variant needs meaningfully different JS behavior, check for the modifier class inside `init`:

```js
export default async function init(el) {
  const isDark = el.classList.contains('dark');
  // ...
}
```

## Content wrappers inside `el`

When a block is authored directly in a page document, `ak.js` runs `groupChildren` on each section before loading blocks. It groups consecutive children into wrapper divs based on element type:

- **`.default-content`** — wraps runs of non-`div` elements (paragraphs, headings, images, inline text)
- **`.block-content`** — wraps runs of `div` elements (nested block containers)

```js
// ak.js — groupChildren (simplified)
// non-div children → .default-content
// div children     → .block-content
```

`loadBlock` preserves these wrappers — they are present in the DOM when `init(el)` runs. Individual block JS may choose to strip them after reading the content, but that is the block's own decision.

Account for the wrappers when querying inside `el`:

```js
export default async function init(el) {
  // Text/heading content sits inside .default-content, not directly in el
  const defaultContent = el.querySelector('.default-content');
  // Nested block divs sit inside .block-content
  const blockContent = el.querySelector('.block-content');
  // Or query specific elements regardless of nesting depth:
  const links = el.querySelectorAll('a');
}
```

Blocks injected by templates (e.g. sitenav, in-page-nav) are created programmatically with no authored content — `el` has no children when `init` starts, so no wrappers are present.

## Block authoring conventions

### Reduce div soup

EDS decoration leaves unnecessary container elements in the DOM. Use `replaceWith` to swap wrapper divs for semantic elements rather than appending inside them.

```js
// Instead of appending into a generic div, replace it with a semantic element
const section = el.querySelector('.default-content');
const article = document.createElement('article');
article.innerHTML = section.innerHTML;
section.replaceWith(article);
```

Where it is necessary to retain classes from a parent or grandparent (e.g. EDS-injected classes), copy them onto the replacement element before calling `replaceWith`.

### Prefer object syntax for DOM data

When reading block content from table rows, assign it to a named object first. This keeps optional chaining isolated to one place and makes the rest of the function readable.

```js
const data = {
  backgroundColor: el.children?.[0]?.innerText?.trim(),
  textContent: el.children?.[1]?.children?.[0],
  imageContent: el.children?.[1]?.children?.[1],
  altText: el.children?.[1]?.children?.[2]?.innerText?.trim(),
  primaryVariant: Boolean(el.children?.[2]?.innerText?.trim()),
};

// Now use the object — no optional chaining clutter in the logic
if (data.primaryVariant) {
  layout.classList.add('my-block--primary');
} else {
  layout.style.background = `var(--spectrum-${data.backgroundColor})`;
}
```

### Use BEM for class names

Use `block__element--modifier` naming for classes added inside a block. The block folder name is the BEM block; elements and modifiers are scoped under it.

```css
/* block */
.my-block { ... }

/* element */
.my-block__heading { ... }
.my-block__image { ... }

/* modifier on the block */
.my-block--primary { ... }

/* modifier on an element */
.my-block__heading--large { ... }
```

The block root class (`my-block`) is set by `loadBlock` from the first class on the element. All additional classes added by `init` should follow BEM from there.

## Known open questions

These were unresolved at the time this skill was written and should be verified before implementing:

1. What is the testing convention for blocks — are there unit tests, and if so what does the test file look like?
